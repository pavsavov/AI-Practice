\# Assignment  

\## AI for Developers – January 2026  

\### Individual Project Assignment  



---



\## Overview



You will create a \*\*Google Drive Document\*\* describing a small software project that you built using:



\- GitHub Copilot  

\- Claude Code  

\- Augment Code  

\- Cursor  

\- Or a combination of these tools  



---



\## Choose Your Own Project Topic



Select any small software system, such as:



\- Script  

\- Automation  

\- API  

\- Mini-app  

\- CLI tool  

\- Or similar  



Describe:



\- The idea  

\- The system requirements  



\*(Maximum: 1 page)\*



---



\## System Architecture – Modules



Use AI to break the system down into several technological modules, for example:



\- Authentication  

\- Data processing  

\- UI  

\- Database layer  

\- Automation step  

\- Testing layer  

\- Etc.  



For each module, describe:



\- Your approach  

\- How AI assisted you  



---



\## Development Process per Module



For \*\*every module\*\*, include:



\- \*\*Approach \& reasoning\*\* – how you planned the solution  

\- \*\*Step-by-step workflow\*\* – what you asked the tool to generate or modify  

\- \*\*Testing strategy\*\* – how you validated correctness  

\- \*\*AI tool choice\*\* – which tool you used (Copilot, Claude Code, Augment, Cursor, etc.) and why  

\- \*\*Key prompts or interactions\*\* (2–3 examples are enough)  



\*(Maximum: half a page per module)\*



---



\## Challenges \& Tool Comparison



Include a section explaining:



\- The biggest challenges you encountered  

\- Which tool helped you the most and why  

\- What you would improve if you continued working on the project  



---



\## Working System Evidence



Include at least \*\*two screenshots\*\* of the functioning system.



Examples:



\- Terminal output  

\- UI  

\- Logs  

\- Postman results  

\- Or any other proof that the implementation works  



---



\## Repository



Provide a link to your \*\*GitHub repository\*\* containing the source code.



---



\## Submission Format



\- Link to Google Drive Document  

&nbsp; \*(Make sure it is shared – “Anyone with the link can view”)\*  



\- \*\*Total size:\*\* typically 3–6 pages
